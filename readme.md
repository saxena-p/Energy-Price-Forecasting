# Price forecasting for Energy Auction Prices

This repository provides a package along with example codes to forecast *Dynamic Containment Low (DCL)* auction prices in the British electricity market.
The entire framework is based on a suite of deep learning based models (LSTM, XGBoost...). 
The modelling pipeline includes feature engineering after statistical data analysis, model development and evaluation, hyperparameter tuning via an optimisation routine, and long-term performance comparison against traditional benchmarks.
